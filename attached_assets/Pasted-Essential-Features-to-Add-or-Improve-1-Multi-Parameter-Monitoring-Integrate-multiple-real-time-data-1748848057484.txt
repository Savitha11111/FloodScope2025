Essential Features to Add or Improve
1. Multi-Parameter Monitoring
Integrate multiple real-time data types (if available via API):

Water level

Rainfall intensity

Soil moisture (if supported)

River/stream flow rates

Weather alerts
This gives a fuller picture of flood risk, not just from water level alone.

2. Dynamic, Location-Specific Thresholds
Set flood alert thresholds that are customized per location (e.g., based on typical river levels or historic flood points), not just generic values.

Adjust thresholds dynamically if the API provides information about seasonal or recent trends.

3. Trend and Rate-of-Change Analysis
Analyze how quickly water levels or rainfall are rising/falling, not just the current value.

Trigger alerts if levels rise unusually fast, even if not yet above the flood threshold.

4. Automated, Multi-Channel Alerting
Send real-time alerts via SMS, app notifications, email, or voice calls to authorities, residents, and infrastructure managers.

Ensure alerts are localized (e.g., only send to users in affected zones).

5. Visual Dashboards and Mapping
Display real-time data on a map/dashboard, showing current risk levels, sensor status, and recent trends for each monitored location.

Allow users to click on a location to see its recent history and current alert status.

6. Historical Data Reference
If your API supports it, display recent historical data (past 24h/48h/7d) alongside real-time readings to help users understand context and trends.

7. System Health and Redundancy Checks
Monitor sensor status and data freshness; flag or suppress alerts from sensors that havenâ€™t updated recently or are reporting outlier values.

Where possible, cross-check data from nearby sensors to reduce false positives.

8. Localized and Adaptive Alerts
Tailor alert messages to specific communities, considering local geography, infrastructure, and population density.

Use local language support for alerts and dashboard interfaces.

9. User Feedback and Reporting
Allow users to report observed flooding, which can help validate and supplement sensor data (if your system has a user interface or app).
