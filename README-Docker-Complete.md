## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone or download the project
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd floodscope-ai

# Build and run the complete application
docker-compose -f docker-compose.complete.yml up --build

# Application will be available at: http://localhost:5000
```

### Option 2: Using Docker directly
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t floodscope-ai:complete .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 \
  -e SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_ID=your_sentinel_hub_client_id_here \
  -e SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sentinel_hub_client_secret_here \
  -e OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here \
  -e GMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com \
  -e GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password \
  --name floodscope-ai-app \
  floodscope-ai:complete

# Application will be available at: http://localhost:5000
```

## API Configuration (Optional)

For enhanced functionality, you can provide these API keys:

### Required for Satellite & Weather Data
```bash
SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_ID=your_sentinel_hub_client_id
SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sentinel_hub_client_secret
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
```

### Optional for Enhanced Features
```bash
AMBEE_API_KEY=your_ambee_api_key      # For advanced flood data
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key    # For AI chat assistant
GMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com       # For email alerts
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password  # For email alerts
```

> 💡 Tip: copy `.env.sample` to `.env`, fill in the values, and pass it to Docker with `--env-file` to keep credentials out of the command history. The application also honours `FLOODSCOPE_ENV_FILE` if you want to load a different credentials file at runtime.
