## Conclusion

**Your flood risk data underestimates the current risk and impact in Bengaluru.**  
- The flood risk is moderate to severe, not low.
- The affected area and water levels are much higher than indicated.
- Rainfall totals are far above your reported value.

Bengaluru is experiencing historic rainfall and significant urban flooding as of late May 2025, with continuing risks due to the early and intense monsoon onset[1][4][5][6].
