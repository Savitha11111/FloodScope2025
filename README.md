## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Installation (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd floodscope-ai
   ```

   <!-- major project  -->

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys (Sentinel Hub credentials are required)
   ```

3. **Run with Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser

### Option 2: Local Installation

#### Windows
```bash
./install.bat
```

#### Mac/Linux
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## üîê Credential Configuration

Sentinel Hub credentials are mandatory for any feature that fetches satellite imagery. FloodScope reads them from the `SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_ID` and `SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables. The application can also load them from a `.env` file so that local development remains convenient.

```bash
# Example .env (see .env.sample for the full template)
SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_ID=your_sentinel_hub_client_id_here
SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sentinel_hub_client_secret_here
```

### Local development

- Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in your credentials before running Streamlit.
- Alternatively export the variables directly (`export SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_ID=...`).
- Use the `FLOODSCOPE_ENV_FILE` variable if you need to point the app at a different credentials file (e.g., when running multiple projects side by side).

### Docker

- `docker-compose.yml` reads the credentials from your shell environment. You can either export them before running `docker compose up` or supply an env file via `docker compose --env-file my.env up`.
- When building custom images, pass the variables at runtime (`docker run -e SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_ID=... -e SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_SECRET=... floodscope-ai`).

### Continuous Integration / Deployment

- Store the credentials as encrypted secrets in your CI platform (e.g., `SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_ID`, `SENTINEL_HUB_CLIENT_SECRET`).
- Inject them into the workflow environment before running tests or deployment steps. The config module fails fast with a descriptive error if the values are missing, so misconfigurations surface immediately.

## üì± How to Use

1. **Select Location:** Click on the map or use the search feature
2. **Run Analysis:** Click "Analyze Flood Risk" to get real-time assessment
