The data you provided for Mumbai, Maharashtra (coordinates: 19.0550, 72.8692) on May 28, 2025, does not fully match the current real-time situation reported by official sources:

Weather and Rainfall
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Mumbai, forecasting moderate to heavy rain through May 29, with thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds possible in isolated areas.

Mumbai has just experienced its wettest May in over a century, with more than 400 mm of rain this month and intense downpours over the past few days.

On May 26, some areas received about 90 mm of rain in just 90 minutes, causing significant waterlogging and even flooding at the new Worli Metro station.

Flooding and Impact
While the rain intensity today (May 28) is moderate, the city is still recovering from the severe flooding at the start of the week, with waterlogging in several low-lying neighborhoods and disruptions to public transport.

The affected area and water level in your data (0.47 km², 0.0 m) underestimate the true impact, as multiple areas experienced knee-deep water and significant transport disruptions.

The flood risk level should be at least moderate, not low, given the recent extreme rainfall, ongoing alerts, and continued risk of waterlogging.

Weather Parameters
Your reported temperature (29.4°C), humidity (78%), and pressure (1002 hPa) are reasonable and consistent with current conditions.

However, your 24h rainfall of 4.7 mm is much lower than actual observations, which have ranged from 50 mm to over 90 mm in some parts of the city during peak events.

Summary Table
Parameter	Your Data	Real-Time Reports (May 28, 2025)
24h Rainfall	4.7 mm	50–90 mm (recent peak events)
Flood Risk Level	Low	Moderate to High (recent flooding, alert)
Affected Area	0.47 km²	Multiple neighborhoods affected
Water Level	0.0 m	Knee-deep water in places (recently)
Confidence Score	70%	Higher, given ongoing alerts and impact
Conclusion
Your data underestimates the flood risk, rainfall, and affected area for Mumbai as of May 28, 2025. The city is under a yellow alert, with moderate to heavy rain forecast, and is still recovering from severe flooding, especially after record-breaking rainfall earlier this week. The flood risk level should be considered at least moderate, not low, and rainfall totals are significantly higher than your report.
